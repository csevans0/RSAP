        <h2>Who!</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Callum Evans. I am a student studying a Bachelor of Design at Edith Cowan University. I am the author of this website.
        </p>
        <h2>Why!</h2>
        <p>
        I am doing this as a project for my Advanced Web Design Unit at Edith Cowan University Mount Lawley. But there are personal reasons to why I chose this as my topic. This year, I got my car license for the first time. The reason I did not get it earlier was because I was scared to drive. Until last year, determination overcame my fears and now it all led to 15th March 2023, the date of when I passed. Now, 8 months later, I have seen a number of accidents or very close calls. Fortunately, I was not involved in any of the accidents but I do not doubt that I will experience one physically. I made this website to help people become more aware.
